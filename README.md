Hi there! Thanks for checking out my page. My name is Lauren and I am an aspiring software engineer specializing in the AR/VR field. I graduate in April 2022 from Holberton in Tulsa, OK and will be ready to work hard and bring out-of-the-box ideas to the table wherever I land. There is still a lot to learn and room to grow, but this repo is a good representation of my work -- for now. :)
